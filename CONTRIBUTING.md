# Contribution guidelines

## Git workflow
### Committing
Commit as often as it's reasonable. Don't wait until your changes pile up on your local working tree.

If you're resolving an issue with your change, make sure to reference the ID number of that issue, as specified in the following section of this guide.

### Commit messages
When writing commit messages, try to adhere to the Angular-style commit message [guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit).

### Issues
If you feel like you have something in mind that could possibly improve this piece of software, feel free to create an issue.

Be specific. Describe everything in detail. If you're requesting a new feature, explain what makes you think that what you're requesting is worth implementing.

If you're reporting a bug, make sure you specify every detail about your running environment. Specify whether a problem is seemingly "random", or you know an exact way of reproducing it. The more details, the better, but try to keep it concise.

### Pull requests
If you're one step farther, and you already made changes to the code, feel free to open a pull request from your fork to this repo. Please give your pull request a title that summarizes your changes. Describe the reasons and intentions of your changes in the description of the pull request.
